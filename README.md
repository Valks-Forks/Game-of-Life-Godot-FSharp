# game_of_life_godot_f-sharp

Attempting to implement [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Godot with F#.

Starting by using [this repository](https://github.com/andrew-wilkes/godot-game-of-life/tree/main) from [this tutorial](https://gdscript.com/projects/game-of-life/) on GDScript.com for inspiration.

Given that this changes from using GDScript to F# as well as from Godot 3 to 4 these will end up being fairly different.
